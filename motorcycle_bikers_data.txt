The bikers rode down the long and narrow path to reach the city park. When they reached a good spot to rest, they began to look for signs of spring. The sun was bright, and a lot of bright red and blue blooms proved to all that warm spring days were the very best. Spring rides were planned. They had a burger at the lake and then rode farther up the mountain. As one rider started to get off his bike, he slipped and fell. One of the other bikers saw him fall but could do nothing to help him. Neither the boy nor the bike got hurt. After a brief stop, everyone was ready to go on. All the bikers enjoyed the nice view when they came to the top. All the roads far below them looked like ribbons. A dozen or so boats could be seen on the lake. It was very quiet and peaceful and no one wished to leave. As they set out on their return, they all enjoyed the ease of pedaling. The bikers came upon a new bike trail. This route led to scenery far grander than that seen from the normal path. The end of the day brought laughs and cheers from everyone. The fact that each person was very, very tired did not keep anyone from eagerly planning for the exciting ride to come.
A motorcycle, often called a motorbike, bike, or cycle, is a two or three-wheeled motor vehicle.[1][2][3] Motorcycle design varies greatly to suit a range of different purposes: long-distance travel, commuting, cruising, sport including racing, and off-road riding. Motorcycling is riding a motorcycle and related social activity such as joining a motorcycle club and attending motorcycle rallies.

The 1885 Daimler Reitwagen made by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Germany was the first internal combustion, petroleum fueled motorcycle. In 1894, Hildebrand & WolfmÃƒÂ¼ller became the first series production motorcycle.[4][5]

In 2014, the three top motorcycle producers globally by volume were Honda (28%), Yamaha (17%) (both from Japan), and Hero MotoCorp (India).[6] In developing countries, motorcycles are considered utilitarian due to lower prices and greater fuel economy. Of all the motorcycles in the world, 58% are in the Asia-Pacific and Southern and Eastern Asia regions, excluding car-centric Japan.

According to the US Department of Transportation, the number of fatalities per vehicle mile traveled was 37 times higher for motorcycles than for cars.[7]
During first word war:
During the First World War, motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with despatch riders on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance and acting as a military police. American company Harley-Davidson was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company Triumph Motorcycles sold more than 30,000 of its Triumph Type H model to allied forces during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc (30.5 cu in) air-cooled four-stroke single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph without pedals.[26][better source needed]

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".[27] Introduced in 1915 it had a 550 cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph".[28].
